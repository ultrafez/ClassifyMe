ClassifyMe
==========

ClassifyMe is a degree classification calculator for degrees at the University of Sheffield. It works on standard modular degrees that are 3 or 4 years long, that have a 1:2 (or 1:2:2 for 4-year) year credit weighting structure.

It is based on the degree classification calculation procedure described on [the University website](http://www.shef.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.109994!/file/LeTS-guidance-new-methodology.pdf), which is summarised on [the Students' Union website](http://www.shef.ac.uk/union/student-advice-centre/academic-university/university-issues-procedures/degree-classification.htm).
