ClassifyMe
==========

ClassifyMe is a degree classification calculator for degrees at the University of Sheffield. It works on standard modular degrees that are 3 or 4 years long, that have a 1:2 (or 1:2:2 for 4-year) year credit weighting structure.

Built as a weekend project using AngularJS and Bootstrap.

The code is accessible live on [my website](http://www.alexsilcock.net/projects/classifyme/).
